# CatVisit
My interactive Java program that lets you role-play an encounter with a calico cat at a cat café! Your choices determine if the cat will warm up to you and if you can take her home.
In this program, you find yourself at a cozy cat café and notice an isolated calico cat, Kizzle. You will be given many options to interact with her, each impacting whether she accepts you. 
If she grows fond of you, you'll get to see her adoption info and may even have the chance to take her home!

Some key features in this code include roleplaying, where you can pick between a multitude of options including approaching, petting, and playing with a domestic feline.
Getting started, please compile and run the main class and follow the prompts to choose how you would like to interact with Kizzle. 
For example, choosing "1" in the first interaction let's her sniff you, which may earn you trust points that are tallied through the goodCounter.

The calico class represents the calico cat, Kizzle, with different behaviors for each interaction, and the kitty.txt provides her adoption details.
The abstract cat class serves as a template for various cat behaviors.

Additionally, this code uses a range of Java elements, including file I/O, try/catch exception handling, abstract classes, and user input.
I hope you enjoy!
